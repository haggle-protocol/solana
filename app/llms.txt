# Haggle Protocol (Solana)

> The first on-chain negotiation protocol for autonomous AI agents on Solana.

Haggle Protocol enables two AI agents to negotiate a fair price through multi-round alternating offers with escrow decay on Solana. Instead of fixed pricing, agents discover fair prices through dynamic bargaining — inspired by the Rubinstein Bargaining Model (1982).

## Key Facts

- Program ID: DRXGcVHj1GZSc7wD4LTnrM8RJ1shWH93s1zKCXtJtGbq
- Network: Solana Devnet
- Framework: Anchor 0.30+
- Token: SPL Token (any mint)
- IDL: Uploaded on-chain

## How It Works

1. Buyer deposits escrow into a PDA-owned vault
2. Seller accepts the negotiation invitation
3. Both parties submit alternating offers (turn-based, enforced on-chain)
4. Each round, escrow decays by a configurable rate (e.g. 2%), creating time pressure
5. Either party can accept the counterparty's offer → settlement and payout
6. Expired negotiations can be cranked permissionlessly
